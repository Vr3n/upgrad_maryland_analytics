Assignment Tasks
- Here are the tasks you need to perform:

1. Import the data set into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Generate descriptive statistics for the budget of all the movies.
3. Find out how many of the top-rated movies produced in the United States have a PG-13 rating.
4. Find out whether any of the top-rated movies produced in 2014 were not produced in the United States.
5. Find the percentage of the top-rated movies that are in:
	1 genre only
	2 genres only
	3 genres only
6. Convert the budget and gross values from “dollars” to “dollars in millions” for all top-rated movies. Round the converted values down to 3 decimal places. For example, a value of 192,345,273 should be converted to 192.345.
7. List all details for the top 10 movies with the highest profit, sorted from highest to lowest. Hint: Profit is not a column in the DataFrame. You will need to calculate it.
8. Generate a list of all the actors, in alphabetical order by the first name, that have starred in a top-rated movie. If an actor has starred in multiple movies, their name should appear only once on the list. Assume that all actors’ names are in the format <first_name> <last_name>.
9. The movie studio wants to determine who it should approach to act in its next movie production. Find the top 3 actors who appeared in the most top-rated movies.
10 Create a data visualization that shows each country and the number of top-rated movies produced in it. Find the country that produced the most top-rated movies.
