    "An experiment was conducted to compare the memory effects of 2 drugsâ€”\"Alprazolam\" and \"Triazolam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, it has been observed that Alprazolam has significant short-term and long-term memory effects on the patients that it is adminstered on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we want to test if Triazolam produces similar or more pronounced effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-Term Memory Effect Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 198 patients were selected for the experiment. Before the experiment, the subjects were required to take a memory test, and the scores were recorded (`Mem_Score_Before`). The subjects were then given the triazolam pill. After being administered the pill, the subjects were asked to take the memory test again, and the scores were recorded (`Mem_Score_After`). The difference between the two scores were also recorded(`Diff`)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Long-Term Memory Effect Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "The patients would then be subjected to one memory test each day for a period of 10 days. If the average scores improved by 20% for a patient, then we would consider that a long-term memory effect has been observed in the patient. The long term effect has been recorded in the column `Long_term` where 1 indicates that a long term effect has been observed, whereas 0 indicates that a long term effect hasn't been observed. \n",
